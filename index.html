    <h2>Big Data: geoJSON</h2>
    <h3>The goal for this assignment is to simulate a data set that you may
      encounter during project week!</h3>
      <h3>Let's focus only on transforming this collection. No need to
        invoke a constructor, or pass off control to Handlebars.</h3>
        <h3>Start simple:
          <ul>
            <li>
							Transform the initial collection into
              an array of each object's properties.
 						</li>
						<strong>We first want to pick up on:</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The zip code
						</li>
						<li>
							Its address (if appliable, otherwise 'undefined')
						</li>
						<li>
							Its neighborhood (same as address, but there should be only one neighborhood for each zip. Remove any additional neighborhoods beyond that - ex: "Greenwich Village, SoHo" becomes "Greenwich Village").
						</li>
						<li>
							Ensure that this new collection also contains the coordinates for each zip. We ideally want this "coordinates" property to be its own object with "lat" and "lng" properties since we'd like to incorporate Google Maps later.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>
						Finally, populate a stats object to pick up on the top five neighborhoods associated with the most zips in Manhattan!
					</li>
					</ul>
